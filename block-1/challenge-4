#Read File in Server

Now that you know how to create an HTTP server and how to read a file off the filesystem in a non-blocking way, let's try to combine the two.
Instead of just writing a string to the HTTP response, use fs.readFile to write the contents of index.html to the response instead.
Note: since fs.readFile is non-blocking, make sure you end the response inside readFile's callback.


ar http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200);
  
  var contents = fs.readFile('index.html',function(err,contents){
 	  response.write(contents);
      response.end();
});

}).listen(8080);
