#Hello  You

Let's start with a simple Hello server. First, tell the response which status it should have (a successful status is 200).
Next, write a message to the response body in the form of "Hello, this is <your name here>". To finish it up, tell the response to end so the client on the other side knows it's received all the data

var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  // Answer goes here.
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.write("Hello, this is Jorge Lavin");
  response.end();
}).listen(8080);
